# Cross-platform command line snake in Python
Snake, but you can run it directly from the command line! Compatible with Windows, Linux and MacOS

# What about performances?
Yes, it sucks on Windows lol. But it runs very smoothly on Linux (and probably MacOS) :D
# How to run it?
## Linux and MacOS
#### If you don't have python 3 installed yet (if you're using Linux it probably is), just search online how to install it
```bash
git clone https://github.com/IlmastroStefanuzzo/py_cli_snake
```
```bash
cd py_cli_snake
```
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
```bash
python3 main.py
```
## Windows
### Compiled .exe file
You can find a "main.exe" file under dist/main. There is a zip file of that folder in the releases
### Python interpreter
Clone the repo to your system with GitHUb Desktop or downloading the zip file from here or whatever  
Open the folder in the file explorer  
`shift + right click` and press `Open Windows Powershell`
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```shell
python main.py
```
